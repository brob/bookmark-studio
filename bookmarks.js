But the trade-off of ditching traditional server-based deployments means that standard approaches to dynamic, asynchronous interactions in our sites and apps aren‚Äôt available anymore.<br /><br />Does that mean that JAMstack sites can‚Äôt handle dynamic interactions? Definitely not!<br /><br />JAMstack sites are great for creating highly dynamic, asynchronous interactions. With some small adjustments to how we think about our code, we can create fun, immersive interactions using only static assets!'
